I have left out the node_modules folder so that the git doesnt need to copy hundreds of files everytime.
Before getting started make sure to 

    npm install
    
while in the folder to download the dependencies from package.json (you probably know this)

Also I am trying out gulp to try and speed up productivity. I already have the gulpfile.js setup already if you wanna use it as well.
